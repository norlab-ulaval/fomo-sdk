# fomo-public-sdk
A public SDK for the FoMo dataset for autonomous driving in multiseasonal conditions
This directory contains tools and scripts for post-processing data collected from the Warthog robot.

## Requirements

- **ROS 2 Humble**: Ensure that ROS 2 Humble is installed and properly sourced before using these tools.
- **Bag Format**: Some scripts in this directory assume that the recorded bag files are in `.mcap` format. Please convert your bag files to `.mcap` if necessary.

## Usage

In the `/post_processing` directory, run the `extract.sh` file to extract Aeva and Ouster pointclouds in the same format as the Boreas dataset. For example, run:
    ```
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    bash extract.sh /path/to/ros2bag/
    ```

This script:
1. Extracts the Aeva and Ouster pointclouds into .bin files named by timestamp
2. Converts the Novatel GPS data to a .log file. Use this .log within Inertial Explorer to obtain the groundtruth file.

## Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies for the scripts are installed and configured correctly.
- If you encounter any issues, verify that your environment matches the requirements.
- Future work should process the output of Inertial Explorer into the format of `gps_post_processed.csv` from the Boreas Dataset


### The Boreas format 

Task on hand need to covert the rosbag from fomo dataset to the boreas format
